# Big-Data-and-Data-Science-Online-Program
The Big Data and Data Science program is an integrated and comprehensive online course designed for adult professionals interested in the field of analytics who wish to develop a broad and in-depth expertise in the spectrum of Big Data and Data Science related technologies. Gaining expertise in multiple data-related skills is essential in the field of analytics in order to adapt to fast changing trends and spontaneous business opportunities revealed by available data.   

Curriculum & Course Details
This Big Data and Data Science program is comprised of four mandatory courses and several non-required electives. Electives are available to students during the program to supplement the learning experience, as well as optional pre-courses which provide a brief review of programming language.

This program covers Big Data technologies like Hadoop and Spark, as these tools create and manage the critical framework for storing and processing vast amounts of data across networks. Student activities will focus on: 

Gaining experience using complex data science algorithms and implementing them using industry-standard processing languages like R, Python and SAS.
Learning how to calculate, interpret and process Big Data insights by creating easily consumable data visualization reports with platforms like Tableau.
Applying concepts to hands-on projects using state-of-the art Machine Learning technology.
Optional Pre-Courses:

These courses are intended to reinforce basic programming knowledge for students who already have a grasp of these foundational concepts. They are not intended to substitute for the recommended year of programming experience. It is recommended that students who lack familiarity in these programming languages review these courses prior to the onset of their studies.  Many students may already have this knowledge, and may choose not to review them. Similar to the elective courses, the optional pre-courses are not mandatory, and lack of completion DOES NOT impact a studentâ€™s overall certificate completion.

Core Java & SQL Training

Students will receive a fundamental introduction to Java, Java Variables, Lambda Expression, SQL Querying and more.
Mandatory Courses:

The most effective way of progressing through this program is by attending the live virtual classroom (LVC) sessions and using online self-paced learning content as study support. While students may choose to take these data sciences courses in any order, the following steps describe the recommended learning progression:

Step 1: Big Data Hadoop and Spark Developer

Learn about Big Data management of large datasets and processing capabilities. Upon completion of this Big Data Hadoop course, students should have a broad exposure of the integrated landscape of Big Data and Data Science.

Step 2: Data Science with Python

These courses provide a strong foundation for analytical and statistical concepts so students can become more familiar with programming.

Step 3: Tableau Desktop 10

Explore data visualization techniques with Tableau, one of the most popular Business Intelligence tools in the market.

Step 4: Machine Learning

This course provides advanced-level training on Machine Learning applications and algorithms. It will give students hands-on experience in multiple, highly sought-after machine learning skills in both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Elective Courses:

The following Big Data and Data Sciences courses are included in this program, but are not required for completion.  They do, however, provide knowledge that would be beneficial in increasing the skill set of an individual seeking a career in data science or analytics.  They can be taken in any order.

Data Science with R
Big Data Hadoop Administrator Course
Python Basics
Apache Cassandra 
Apache Kafka
Apache Spark and Scala
MongoDB Developer and Administrator
Business Analytics with Excel
About the Live Virtual Classroom

Classes are delivered through a WebEx portal that includes a live instructor, a teaching assistant (TA) and a maximum of 20 participants. These sessions are highly interactive and students are free to ask questions, which are answered by the instructor/TA in real time.  Students will be able to sign up for live virtual sessions that fit within their schedule once they have access to the learning management system. Live classes are recorded to accommodate student absences. Attendance is not mandatory for these classes and can be attended by students at their discretion.  Students may choose to attend all or none of the classes, as it will not have any bearing on their completion of the program.

About the Live Mentoring Sessions

In additional to Live Virtual Classes, we also offer Live Mentoring Sessions on a monthly basis. These sessions are virtual meetings where an industry expert in the field of Big Data and Data Science will be on hand to answer questions, guide you through areas of your course as needed and provide real-world experience and advice. These sessions are also optional and open to all! They provide a discussion forum for you to ask questions related to Big Data, Data Science and other topics within the course.

*Please note that the instructors who lead the Live Virtual Classroom are not always the same as those who lead the monthly Live Mentoring sessions.
